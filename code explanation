first declared bin function and calc function
then starting from main
takek size of array from user
Entered numbers in array list
passing all numbers one by one to bin function which will convert decimal to binary number
bin function will take help of calc function to calculate size of array 
then bin funxction will store remainder of number in array one by one
then printing all modulus all together
and this will repeat untill all decumal number converted to binary number.

Thank You
